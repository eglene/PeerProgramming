War Card Game Implementation

Overview

This project implements the classic children's card game called "War." The game's main objective is to provide entertainment by simulating a card game where two players compete to win all the cards.

Requirements

Technical Requirements

1. Object-Oriented Programming: The game must be implemented using the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

2. Git Integration: Utilize Git for version control, committing regularly, and pushing to a remote repository.

3. Remote Pair Programming: Collaborate with a partner remotely, ensuring that both parties contribute to the project's development.


Functional Requirements

1. Card Deck: Implement a standard 52-card deck with four suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, and Spades.

2. Game Initialization:
  Shuffle the deck.
  Divide the deck evenly between two players.

3. Gameplay Mechanics:
  Players draw the top card from their decks.
  The player with the higher card (based on rank and suit) wins both cards and places them at the bottom of their deck.
  In case of a tie, initiate a "war" scenario where each player draws three additional cards, and the process repeats until one player has a higher-ranked card.

4. Winning Condition: The game continues until one player collects all the cards. Declare the winner.

Optional Enhancements

1. User Interaction: Implement a command-line interface allowing users to interact with the game, make choices, and view game progress.

2. Variation: Introduce variations to the standard game as described in the Wikipedia article or any other creative modifications.
